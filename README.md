# ASIC Design Flow Simulation of 4-bit Counter

This project demonstrates the complete ASIC design flow
from RTL design to GDSII using open-source VLSI tools.

## Objective
To understand and document the RTL to GDSII flow
using a simple 4-bit synchronous counter.

## Tools Referenced
Verilog HDL  
Yosys  
OpenROAD  
KLayout  
GTKWave  

## Design Description
A 4-bit synchronous counter is designed using Verilog HDL.
The counter increments on every positive clock edge
and resets to zero on reset.

## ASIC Design Flow
1. RTL Design using Verilog
2. Functional Verification using Testbench
3. Logic Synthesis
4. Floorplanning
5. Placement
6. Routing
7. GDSII Layout Visualization

The design flow was studied and verified using
open-source tool documentation and reference outputs.

## Results
RTL and testbench were successfully created.
Synthesis and physical design stages were analyzed
through open-source VLSI references.

## Conclusion
This project provides a beginner-level understanding
of ASIC design flow using open-source tools.
